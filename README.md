# Flutter generative AI sample

A Flutter chat application that uses the `google_generative_ai` package.

## Getting started

To use the Gemini API, you'll need an API key. If you don't already have one, 
create a key in Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey.

Then simply replase your api key in lib/constants.dart -->'YOUR_API_KEY'.
